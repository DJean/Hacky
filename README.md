## Introduction

Hacky for Mac provides browsing Hacker News in a clean and minimalistic way:

+ Read / Unread Markers
+ Twitter Support
+ Send to Instapaper
+ Retina ready

## Installation

You need the latest version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for building the source. Alternatively you can install Hacky via the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hacky/id584949645?ls=1&mt=12).

## FAQ

__Q:__ The Hacker News website provides much more functionality than your app.

__A:__ That's right. The app isn't made to replace the Hacker News website. It's made for frequent readers like me who want a quick and friendly-on-the-eye way to access the stories.

__Q:__ I want your app but I don't want to pay for it.

__A:__ No problem, Hacky is open source! Just get a copy of the source on GitHub and build it on your machine.

__Q:__ Why are you then charging money for it in the first place?

__A:__ Personally I like getting my apps via Mac App Store. It means easy updating and restoring. Unfortunately providing an app in the MAS isn't free for the developer as he has to purchase a Developer Certificate from Apple. (Additionally a developer likes to buy a beer from time to time)
